This is a chess AI written in C++ with a front end in Objective C. 

The engine uses object oriented principles, multithreading, and reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to decide which move to make. 

A minimax tree with a fixed ply of 4 is used (although this will in the future be changed to use variable ply). Tree searching and generation is performed by multiple threads.

The front end uses simplified ray tracing to intersect user presses with the board. The interface was created with OpenGL.
